/**
 * This class object combines the rendered output of a 3-d from one or more
 * linear (e.g.  perspective) cameras, as seen through a single, possibly
 * nonlinear camera.
 *
 * This can be used to generate real-time imagery of a 3-d scene using a
 * nonlinear camera, for instance a fisheye camera, even though the underlying
 * graphics engine may only support linear cameras.  It can also pre-distort
 * imagery to compensate for off-axis projectors, and/or curved screens of any
 * complexity.
 *

 *
 * A NonlinearImager may be visualized as a dark room into which a number of
 * projection screens have been placed, of arbitrary size and shape and at any
 * arbitrary position and orientation to each other.  Onto each of these
 * screens is projected the view as seen by a normal perspective camera that
 * exists in the world (that is, under render).
 *
 * There also exist in the room one or more (possibly nonlinear) cameras,
 * called viewers, that observe these screens.  The image of the projection
 * screens seen by each viewer is finally displayed on the viewer's associated
 * DisplayRegion.  By placing the viewer(s) appropriately relative to the
 * screens, and by choosing suitable lens properties for the viewer(s), you
 * can achieve a wide variety of distortion effects.
 *

 *
 * There are several different LensNode (Camera) objects involved at each
 * stage in the process.  To help keep them all straight, different words are
 * used to refer to each different kind of Camera used within this object.
 * The camera(s) under render, that capture the original view of the world to
 * be projected onto the screens, are called source cameras, and are set per
 * screen via set_source_camera().  The LensNode that is associated with each
 * screen to project the image as seen from the screen's source camera is
 * called a projector; these are set via the ProjectionScreen::set_projector()
 * interface.  Finally, the cameras that view the whole configuration of
 * screens are called viewers; each of these is associated with a
 * DisplayRegion, and they are set via set_viewer_camera().
 *
 * Of all these lenses, only the source cameras must use linear (that is,
 * perspective or orthographic) lenses.  The projectors and viewers may be any
 * arbitrary lens, linear or otherwise.
