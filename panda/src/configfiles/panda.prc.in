# The egg loader is handy to have available by default.  This allows
# clients to load egg files.  (The bam loader is built-in so bam files
# are always loadable).

# By qualifying with the extension "egg", we indicate the egg loader
# should be made available only if you explicitly name a file with an
# .egg extension.

# Also see ptloader, which is built as part of pandatool; it allows
# files of more exotic types (like .flt, .mb, .lwo, and .dxf) to be
# loaded directly into Panda.

# These entries work very similar to load-file-type, except they are

# The * is a special catch-all extension that is consulted unless a
# loader has been defined with an explicit extension.

# sophisticated egg syntax into the generated egg file, using a single
