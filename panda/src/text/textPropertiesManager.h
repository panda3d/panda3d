/**
 * This defines all of the TextProperties structures that might be referenced
 * by name from an embedded text string.
 *
 * A text string, as rendered by a TextNode, can contain embedded references
 * to one of the TextProperties defined here, by enclosing the name between \1
 * (ASCII 0x01) characters; this causes a "push" to the named state.  All text
 * following the closing \1 character will then be rendered in the new state.
 * The next \2 (ASCII 0x02) character will then restore the previous state for
 * subsequent text.
 *
 * For instance, "x\1up\1n\2 + y" indicates that the character "x" will be
 * rendered in the normal state, the character "n" will be rendered in the
 * "up" state, and then " + y" will be rendered in the normal state again.
 *
 * This can also be used to define arbitrary models that can serve as embedded
 * graphic images in a text paragraph.  This works similarly; the convention
 * is to create a TextGraphic that describes the graphic image, and then
 * associate it here via the set_graphic() call.  Then "\5name\5" will embed
 * the named graphic.
