/**
 * Generates a non-reversible hash of a particular length based on an
 * arbitrary password and a random salt.  This is much stronger than the
 * algorithm implemented by the standard Unix crypt().
 *
 * The resulting hash can be useful for two primary purposes: (1) the hash may
 * be recorded to disk in lieu of recording plaintext passwords, for
 * validation against a password entered by the user later (which should
 * produce the same hash given a particular salt), or (2) the hash may be used
 * as input to an encryption algorithm that requires a key of a particular
 * length.
 *
 * password is the text password provided by a user.
 *
 * salt should be a string of arbitrary random bytes (it need not be
 * crypotographically secure, just different for each different hash).
 *
 * iters should be a number in the thousands to indicate the number of times
 * the hash algorithm should be applied.  In general, iters should be chosen
 * to make the computation as expensive as it can be and still be tolerable,
 * to reduce the attractiveness of a brute-force attack.
 *
 * keylen is the length in bytes of the required key hash.
