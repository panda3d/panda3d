/**
 * This file defines the classes PointerTo and ConstPointerTo (and their
 * abbreviations, PT and CPT).  These should be used in place of traditional
 * C-style pointers wherever implicit reference counting is desired.
 *
 * The syntax is:                     instead of:
 *
 *    PointerTo<MyClass> p;            MyClass *p;
 *    PT(MyClass) p;
 *
 *    ConstPointerTo<MyClass> p;       const MyClass *p;
 *    CPT(MyClass) p;
 *
 * PointerTo and ConstPointerTo will automatically increment the object's
 * reference count while the pointer is kept.  When the PointerTo object is
 * reassigned or goes out of scope, the reference count is automatically
 * decremented.  If the reference count reaches zero, the object is freed.
 *
 * Note that const PointerTo<MyClass> is different from
 * ConstPointerTo<MyClass>.  A const PointerTo may not reassign its pointer,
 * but it may still modify the contents at that address.  On the other hand, a
 * ConstPointerTo may reassign its pointer at will, but may not modify the
 * contents.  It is like the difference between (MyClass * const) and
 * (const MyClass *).
 *
 * In order to use PointerTo, it is necessary that the thing pointed to
 * --MyClass in the above example--either inherits from ReferenceCount, or is
 * a proxy built with RefCountProxy or RefCountObj (see referenceCount.h).
 * However, also see PointerToArray, which does not have this restriction.
 *
 * It is crucial that the PointerTo object is only used to refer to objects
 * allocated from the free store, for which delete is a sensible thing to do.
 * If you assign a PointerTo to an automatic variable (allocated from the
 * stack, for instance), bad things will certainly happen when the reference
 * count reaches zero and it tries to delete it.
 *
 * It's also important to remember that, as always, a virtual destructor is
 * required if you plan to support polymorphism.  That is, if you define a
 * PointerTo to some base type, and assign to it instances of a class derived
 * from that base class, the base class must have a virtual destructor in
 * order to properly destruct the derived object when it is deleted.
