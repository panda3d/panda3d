/**
 * This is a list of pointers returned by a MemoryUsage object in response to
 * some query.
 *
 * Warning: once pointers are stored in a MemoryUsagePointers object, they are
 * reference-counted, and will not be freed until the MemoryUsagePointers
 * object is freed (or clear() is called on the object).  However, they may
 * not even be freed then; pointers may leak once they have been added to this
 * structure.  This is because we don't store enough information in this
 * structure to correctly free the pointers that have been added.  Since this
 * is intended primarily as a debugging tool, this is not a major issue.
 *
 * This class is just a user interface to talk about pointers stored in a
 * MemoryUsage object.  It doesn't even exist when compiled with NDEBUG.
