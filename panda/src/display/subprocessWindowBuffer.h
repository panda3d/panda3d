/**
 * This is a special class that is designed to faciliate SubprocessWindow.
 * It's intended to be allocated within a shared memory buffer, and it
 * contains space for a framebuffer image to be stored for transferring
 * between processes, as well as appropriate synchronization primitives.
 *
 * It's designed to be compiled outside of Panda, so that code that doesn't
 * link with Panda (in particular, the Panda3D plugin core API) may still link
 * with this and use it.
 *
 * At the moment, and maybe indefinitely, it is only compiled on OSX, and only
 * when we are building support for the plugin; because it is only needed
 * then.
