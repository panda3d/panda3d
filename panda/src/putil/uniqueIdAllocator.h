/**
 * Manage a set of ID values from min to max inclusive.  The ID numbers that
 * are freed will be allocated (reused) in the same order.  I.e.  the oldest
 * ID numbers will be allocated.
 *
 * This implementation will use 4 bytes per id number, plus a few bytes of
 * management data.  e.g.  10,000 ID numbers will use 40KB.
 *
 * Also be advised that ID -1 and -2 are used internally by the allocator.  If
 * allocate returns IndexEnd (-1) then the allocator is out of free ID
 * numbers.
 *
 * There are other implementations that can better leverage runs of used or
 * unused IDs or use bit arrays for the IDs.  But, it takes extra work to
 * track the age of freed IDs, which is required for what we wanted.  If you
 * would like to kick around other implementation ideas, please contact
 * Schuyler.
