/**
 * A Factory can be used to create an instance of a particular subclass of
 * some general base class.  Each subclass registers itself with the Factory,
 * supplying a function that will construct an instance of that subclass; the
 * Factory can later choose a suitable subclass and return a newly-constructed
 * pointer to an object of that type on the user's demand.  This is used, for
 * instance, to manage the set of GraphicsPipes available to the user.
 *
 * This is a thin template wrapper around FactoryBase.  All it does is ensure
 * the types are correctly cast.  All of its methods are inline, and it has no
 * data members, so it is not necessary to export the class from the DLL.
