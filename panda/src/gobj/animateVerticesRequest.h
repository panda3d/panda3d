/**
 * This class object manages a single asynchronous request to animate vertices
 * on a GeomVertexData object.  animate_vertices will be called with
 * force=true (i.e.  blocking) in a sub-thread (if threading is available).
 * No result is stored or returned from this object.  It is expected that the
 * result will be cached and available for immediate use later during
 * rendering.  Thus it is important that the main thread block while these
 * requests are being run (presumably on multiple CPUs/cores), to ensure that
 * the data has been computed by the time it's needed.
