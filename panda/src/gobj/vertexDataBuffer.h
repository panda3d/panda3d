/**
 * A block of bytes that stores the actual raw vertex data referenced by a
 * GeomVertexArrayData object.
 *
 * At any point, a buffer may be in any of two states:
 *
 * independent - the buffer's memory is resident, and owned by the
 * VertexDataBuffer object itself (in _resident_data).  In this state,
 * _reserved_size might be greater than or equal to _size.
 *
 * paged - the buffer's memory is owned by a VertexDataBlock.  That block
 * might itself be resident, compressed, or paged to disk.  If it is resident,
 * the memory may still be accessed directly from the block.  However, this
 * memory is considered read-only.  In this state, _reserved_size will always
 * equal _size.
 *
 * VertexDataBuffers start out in independent state.  They get moved to paged
 * state when their owning GeomVertexArrayData objects get evicted from the
 * _independent_lru.  They can get moved back to independent state if they are
 * modified (e.g.  get_write_pointer() or realloc() is called).
 *
 * The idea is to keep the highly dynamic and frequently-modified
 * VertexDataBuffers resident in easy-to-access memory, while collecting the
 * static and rarely accessed VertexDataBuffers together onto pages, where
 * they may be written to disk as a block when necessary.
