/**
 * This object describes how the vertex animation, if any, represented in a
 * GeomVertexData is encoded.
 *
 * Vertex animation includes soft-skinned skeleton animation and morphs (blend
 * shapes), and might be performed on the CPU by Panda, or passed down to the
 * graphics backed to be performed on the hardware (depending on the
 * hardware's advertised capabilities).
 *
 * Changing this setting doesn't by itself change the way the animation is
 * actually performed; this just specifies how the vertices are set up to be
 * animated.
