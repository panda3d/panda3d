/**
 * This flavor of ConnectionReader will read from its sockets and retain only
 * the single most recent datagram for inspection by client code.  It's useful
 * particularly for reading telemetry-type data from UDP sockets where you
 * don't care about getting every last socket, and in fact if the sockets are
 * coming too fast you'd prefer to skip some of them.
 *
 * This class will always create one thread for itself.
