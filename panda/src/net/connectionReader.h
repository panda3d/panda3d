/**
 * This is an abstract base class for a family of classes that listen for
 * activity on a socket and respond to it, for instance by reading a datagram
 * and serving it (or queueing it up for later service).
 *
 * A ConnectionReader may define an arbitrary number of threads (at least one)
 * to process datagrams coming in from an arbitrary number of sockets that it
 * is monitoring.  The number of threads is specified at construction time and
 * cannot be changed, but the set of sockets that is to be monitored may be
 * constantly modified at will.
 *
 * This is an abstract class because it doesn't define how to process each
 * received datagram.  See QueuedConnectionReader.  Also note that
 * ConnectionListener derives from this class, extending it to accept
 * connections on a rendezvous socket rather than read datagrams.
