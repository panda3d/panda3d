/**
 * Reads the mouse and/or keyboard data sent from a GraphicsWindow, and
 * transmits it down the data graph.
 *
 * The mouse and keyboard devices are bundled together into one device here,
 * because they interrelate so much.  A mouse might be constrained by the
 * holding down of the shift key, for instance, or the clicking of the mouse
 * button might be handled in much the same way as a keyboard key.
 *
 * Mouse data is sent down the data graph as an x,y position as well as the
 * set of buttons currently being held down; keyboard data is sent down as a
 * set of keypress events in an EventDataTransition.  To throw these events to
 * the system, you must attach an EventThrower to the MouseAndKeyboard object;
 * otherwise, the events will be discarded.
