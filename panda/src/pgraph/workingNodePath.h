/**
 * This is a class designed to support low-overhead traversals of the complete
 * scene graph, with a memory of the complete path through the graph at any
 * given point.
 *
 * You could just use a regular NodePath to do this, but since the NodePath
 * requires storing NodePathComponents on each node as it is constructed, and
 * then removing them when it destructs, there is considerable overhead in
 * that approach.
 *
 * The WorkingNodePath eliminates this overhead (but does not guarantee
 * consistency if the scene graph changes while the path is held).
 *
 * At any given point, you may ask the WorkingNodePath for its actual
 * NodePath, and it will construct and return a new NodePath representing the
 * complete generated chain.
