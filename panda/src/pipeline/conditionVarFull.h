/**
 * This class implements a condition variable; see ConditionVar for a brief
 * introduction to this class.  The ConditionVarFull class provides a more
 * complete implementation than ConditionVar; in particular, it provides the
 * notify_all() method, which is guaranteed to wake up all threads currently
 * waiting on the condition (whereas notify() is guaranteed to wake up at
 * least one thread, but may or may not wake up all of them).
 *
 * This class exists because on certain platforms (e.g.  Win32), implementing
 * notify_all() requires more overhead, so you should use ConditionVar for
 * cases when you do not require the notify_all() semantics.
 *
 * There are still some minor semantics that POSIX condition variables provide
 * which this implementation does not.  For instance, it is required (not
 * optional) that the caller of notify() or notify_all() is holding the
 * condition variable's mutex before the call.
 *
 * This class inherits its implementation either from ConditionVarFullDebug or
 * ConditionVarFullDirect, depending on the definition of DEBUG_THREADS.
