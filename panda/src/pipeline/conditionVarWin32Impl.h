/**
 * Uses Windows native calls to implement a ConditionVar.
 *
 * On Windows Vista and above, we use the system's native condition variables.
 *
 * On Windows XP, we follow the "SetEvent" implementation suggested by
 * http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/win32-cv-1.html . This allows us to
 * implement both notify() and notify_all().
 *
 * As described by the above reference, this implementation suffers from a few
 * weaknesses; in particular, it does not necessarily wake up all threads
 * fairly; and it may sometimes incorrectly wake up a thread that was not
 * waiting at the time notify() was called.  But we figure it's good enough
 * for our purposes.
