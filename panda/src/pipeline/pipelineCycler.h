/**
 * This class maintains different copies of a page of data between stages of
 * the graphics pipeline (or any other pipelining context).
 *
 * The class object maintains up to n copies of a CycleData structure, one for
 * each stage of the pipeline.  The head of the pipeline is responsible for
 * making changes to its copy, which are then cycled through the pipeline at
 * each frame.
 *
 * To access the data, you must first ask for a readable pointer.  In order to
 * make changes to the data, you must ask for a writable pointer.  Both kinds
 * of pointers should be released when you are done, as a sanity check.  The
 * CycleDataReader and CycleDataWriter classes transparently handle this.
 *
 * If pipelining support is not enabled at compile time (that is,
 * DO_PIPELINING is not defined), this object compiles to a minimum object
 * that presents the same interface but with minimal runtime overhead.
 *
 * We define this as a struct instead of a class to guarantee byte placement
 * within the object, so that (particularly for the trivial implementation)
 * the inherited struct's data is likely to be placed by the compiler at the
 * "this" pointer.
