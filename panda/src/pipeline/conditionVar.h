/**
 * A condition variable, usually used to communicate information about
 * changing state to a thread that is waiting for something to happen.  A
 * condition variable can be used to "wake up" a thread when some arbitrary
 * condition has changed.
 *
 * The ConditionVar class does not support the full semantics of POSIX
 * condition variables.  In particular, it does not support the broadcast or
 * notify_all function.  See ConditionVarFull for a more complete (but
 * possibly more expensive) API.
 *
 * A condition variable is associated with a single mutex, and several
 * condition variables may share the same mutex.
 *
 * This class inherits its implementation either from ConditionVarDebug or
 * ConditionVarDirect, depending on the definition of DEBUG_THREADS.
