/**
 * A classic semaphore synchronization primitive.
 *
 * A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
 * acquire() call and incremented by each release() call.  The counter can
 * never go below zero; when acquire() finds that it is zero, it blocks,
 * waiting until some other thread calls release().
