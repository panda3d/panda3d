/*
 * This file is used throughout this directory, in conjunction with
 * dblnames.h, to implement a poor man's template of the linmath objects on
 * numeric type.  The idea is to #include either fltnames.h or dblnames.h (or,
 * in theory, intnames.h or any other numeric type we wanted to implement) and
 * then to include the various *_src.h andor *_src.cxx files that actually
 * define the linmath objects.  We do this instead of using actual templates
 * to avoid some of the inherent problems with templates: compiler complexity
 * and distributed code bloat, for instance; plus it allows us to implement
 * if-based specialization on numeric type for compilers (like VC++) that
 * don't completely support template specialization.  That and the fact that
 * VC++ seems to have a particularly bad time with templates in general.
