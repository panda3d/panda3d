# This tutorial demonstrates the use of tasks. A task is a function that
# gets called once every frame. They are good for things that need to be
# updated very often. In the case of asteroids, we use tasks to update
# the positions of all the objects, and to check if the bullets or the
# ship have hit the asteroids.
#
# Note: This definitely a complicated example. Tasks are the cores of
# most games so it seemed appropriate to show what a full game in Panda
# could look like.
