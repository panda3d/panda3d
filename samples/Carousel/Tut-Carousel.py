# This tutorial will demonstrate some uses for intervals in Panda
# to move objects in your panda world.
# Intervals are tools that change a value of something, like position, rotation
# or anything else, linearly, over a set period of time. They can be also be
# combined to work in sequence or in Parallel
# 
# In this lesson, we will simulate a carousel in motion using intervals.
# The carousel will spin using an hprInterval while 4 pandas will represent
# the horses on a traditional carousel. The 4 pandas will rotate with the
# carousel and also move up and down on their poles using a LerpFunc interval.
# Finally there will also be lights on the outer edge of the carousel that
# will turn on and off by switching their texture with intervals in Sequence
# and Parallel

  def startCarousel(self):
    #Here's where we actually create the intervals to move the carousel
    #The first type of interval we use is one created directly from a NodePath
    #This interval tells the NodePath to vary its orientation (hpr) from its
    #current value (0,0,0) to (360,0,0) over 20 seconds. Intervals created from
    #NodePaths also exist for position, scale, color, and shear
  
    self.carouselSpin = self.carousel.hprInterval(20, Vec3(360, 0, 0))
    #Once an interval is created, we need to tell it to actually move.
    #start() will cause an interval to play once. loop() will tell an interval
    #to repeat once it finished. To keep the carousel turning, we use loop()
    self.carouselSpin.loop()

    #The next type of interval we use is called a LerpFunc interval. It is
    #called that becuase it linearly interpolates (aka Lerp) values passed to
    #a function over a given amount of time.

    #In this specific case, horses on a carousel don't move contantly up,
    #suddenly stop, and then contantly move down again. Instead, they start
    #slowly, get fast in the middle, and slow down at the top. This motion is
    #close to a sine wave. This LerpFunc calls the function oscilatePanda
    #(which we will create below), which changes the hieght of the panda based
    #on the sin of the value passed in. In this way we achieve non-linear
    #motion by linearly changing the input to a function
    for i in range(4):
      self.moves[i] = LerpFunc(
                      self.oscilatePanda,  #function to call
                      duration = 3,  #3 second duration

                                     #Additional information to pass to
                                     #self.oscialtePanda

                      )
      #again, we want these to play continuously so we start them with loop()
      self.moves[i].loop()

    #Finally, we combine Sequence, Parallel, Func, and Wait intervals,
    #to schedule texture swapping on the lights to simulate the lights turning
    #on and off.
    #Sequence intervals play other intervals in a sequence. In other words,
    #it waits for the current interval to finish before playing the next
    #one.
    #Parallel intervals play a group of intervals at the same time
    #Wait intervals simply do nothing for a given amount of time
    #Func intervals simply make a single function call. This is helpful because
    #it allows us to schedule functions to be called in a larger sequence. They
    #take virtually no time so they don't cause a Sequence to wait.

    self.lightBlink = Sequence(
      #For the first step in our sequence we will set the on texture on one
      #light and set the off texture on the other light at the same time
      Parallel(
        Func(self.lights1.setTexture, self.lightOnTex, 1),
        Func(self.lights2.setTexture, self.lightOffTex, 1)),

      #Then we will switch the textures at the same time

  def oscilatePanda(self, rad, panda, offset):
    #This is the oscillation function mentioned earlier. It takes in a degree
    #value, a NodePath to set the height on, and an offset. The offset is there
