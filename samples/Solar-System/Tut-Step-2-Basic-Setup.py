# This tutorial is intended as a initial panda scripting lesson going over
# display initialization, loading models, placing objects, and the scene graph.
#
# Step 2: After initializing panda, we define a class called World. We put
# all of our code in a class to provide a convenient way to keep track of
# all of the variables our project will use, and in later tutorials to handle
# keyboard input.
# The code contained in the __init__ method is executed when we instantiate
# the class (at the end of this file).  Inside __init__ we will first change
# the background color of the window.  We then disable the mouse-based camera
# control and set the camera position.

import direct.directbase.DirectStart  #Initialize Panda and create a window
from panda3d.core import *     #Contains most of Panda's modules
from direct.gui.DirectGui import *    #Imports Gui objects we use for putting
                                      #text on the screen
import sys

class World:                          #Our main class
  def __init__(self):                 #The initialization method caused when a
                                      #world object is created
  
    #Create some text overlayed on our screen.
    #We will use similar commands in all of our tutorials to create titles and
    #instruction guides. 
    self.title = OnscreenText(
      text="Panda3D: Tutorial 1 - Solar System",
      style=1, fg=(1,1,1,1), pos=(0.8,-0.95), scale = .07)
  
    #Make the background color black (R=0, G=0, B=0)
    #instead of the default grey
    base.setBackgroundColor(0, 0, 0)
    
    #By default, the mouse controls the camera. Often, we disable that so that
    #the camera can be placed manually (if we don't do this, our placement
    #commands will be overridden by the mouse control)
    base.disableMouse()
    
    #Set the camera position (x, y, z)
    camera.setPos ( 0, 0, 45 )
    
    #Set the camera orientation (heading, pitch, roll) in degrees
    camera.setHpr ( 0, -90, 0 )
#end class world

#Now that our class is defined, we create an instance of it.
#Doing so calls the __init__ method set up above
w = World()
#As usual - run() must be called before anything can be shown on screen
run()
