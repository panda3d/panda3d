# This tutorial is intended as a initial panda scripting lesson going over
# display initialization, loading models, placing objects, and the scene graph.
#
# Step 1: DirectStart contains the main Panda3D modules. Importing it
# initializes Panda and creates the window. The run() command causes the
# real-time simulation to begin

import direct.directbase.DirectStart

run()
