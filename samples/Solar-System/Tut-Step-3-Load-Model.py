# This tutorial is intended as a initial panda scripting lesson going over
# display initialization, loading models, placing objects, and the scene graph.
#
# Step 3: In this step, we create a function called loadPlanets, which will
# eventually be used to load all of the planets in our simulation. For now
# we will load just the sun and and the sky-sphere we use to create the
# star-field.

class World:
  def __init__(self):
    #This is the initialization we had before
    self.title = OnscreenText(          #Create the title
      text="Panda3D: Tutorial 1 - Solar System",
      style=1, fg=(1,1,1,1), pos=(0.8,-0.95), scale = .07)
  
    base.setBackgroundColor(0, 0, 0)    #Set the background to black
    base.disableMouse()                 #disable mouse control of the camera
    camera.setPos ( 0, 0, 45 )          #Set the camera position (X, Y, Z)
    camera.setHpr ( 0, -90, 0 )         #Set the camera orientation
                                        #(heading, pitch, roll) in degrees

    #We will now define a variable to help keep a consistent scale in
    #our model. As we progress, we will continue to add variables here as we
    #need them

    #The value of this variable scales the size of the planets. True scale size
    #would be 1
    self.sizescale = 0.6
    
    #Now that we have finished basic initialization, we call loadPlanets which
    #will handle actually getting our objects in the world
    self.loadPlanets()

  def loadPlanets(self):
    #Here, inside our class, is where we are creating the loadPlanets function
    #For now we are just loading the star-field and sun. In the next step we
    #will load all of the planets

    #Loading objects in Panda is done via the command loader.loadModel, which
    #takes one argument, the path to the model file. Models in Panda come in
    #two types, .egg (which is readable in a text editor), and .bam (which is
    #not readable but makes smaller files). When you load a file you leave the
    #extension off so that it can choose the right version

    #Load model returns a NodePath, which you can think of as an object
    #containing your model
    
    #Here we load the sky model. For all the planets we will use the same
    #sphere model and simply change textures. However, even though the sky is
    #a sphere, it is different from the planet model because its polygons
    #(which are always one-sided in Panda) face inside the sphere instead of
    #outside (this is known as a model with reversed normals). Because of
    #that it has to be a separate model.
    self.sky = loader.loadModel("models/solar_sky_sphere")

    #After the object is loaded, it must be placed in the scene. We do this by
    #changing the parent of self.sky to render, which is a special NodePath.
    #Each frame, Panda starts with render and renders everything attached to
    #it.
    self.sky.reparentTo(render)

    #You can set the position, orientation, and scale on a NodePath the same
    #way that you set those properties on the camera. In fact, the camera is
    #just another special NodePath
    self.sky.setScale(40)

    #Very often, the egg file will know what textures are needed and load them
    #automatically. But sometimes we want to set our textures manually, (for
    #instance we want to put different textures on the same planet model)
    #Loading textures works the same way as loading models, but instead of
    #calling loader.loadModel, we call loader.loadTexture
    self.sky_tex = loader.loadTexture("models/stars_1k_tex.jpg")
    
    #Finally, the following line sets our new sky texture on our sky model.
    #The second argument must be one or the command will be ignored.
    self.sky.setTexture(self.sky_tex, 1)

    #Now we load the sun.
    self.sun = loader.loadModel("models/planet_sphere")
    #Now we repeat our other steps
    self.sun.reparentTo(render)
    self.sun_tex = loader.loadTexture("models/sun_1k_tex.jpg")
    self.sun.setTexture(self.sun_tex, 1)
    self.sun.setScale(2 * self.sizescale) #The sun is really much bigger than
                                          #this, but to be able to see the
                                          #planets we're making it smaller

  #end loadPlanets()
    
#end class world

#instantiate the class
