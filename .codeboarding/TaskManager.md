## Component Details



One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.



### TaskManager

Manages and executes tasks within the game, handling their lifecycle from creation to completion. It provides methods for adding, removing, and stepping through tasks, and integrates with Panda3D's AsyncTaskManager.

### Task

Represents an individual unit of work or action within the game. It is an alias for `panda3d.core.PythonTask`, which is a Python-level wrapper around the C++ `AsyncTask` interface. Tasks can have properties like a name, a callback function, and can be managed by the `TaskManager`.
