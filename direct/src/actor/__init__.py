"""
This package contains the :class:`.Actor` class as well as a
distributed variant thereof.  Actor is a high-level interface around
the lower-level :class:`panda3d.core.Character` implementation.
It loads and controls an animated character and manages the animations
playing on it.

See the :ref:`models-and-actors` page in the Programming Guide to learn
more about loading models and animated actors.
