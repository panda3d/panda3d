    """
    This class manages a relationship between DistributedObjects that
    know about each other, and are expected to be generated together.
    Ideally, we should be able to guarantee the ordering of the
    generate calls, but there are certain cases in which the objects
    may not be generated in the correct order as defined by the
    toon.dc file.

    To handle cases like these robustly, it is necessary for each
    object to deal with the possibility that its companion object has
    not yet been generated.  This may mean deferring some operations
    until the expected companion object has been generated.

    This class helps manage that process.  To use it, an object should
    register its desire to be associated with the other object's doId.
    When the other object is generated (or immediately, if the object
    already exists), the associated callback will be called.  There is
    also a timeout callback in case the object never appears.

        Requests a callback to be called when the objects in the
        doIdList are generated.  The allCallback will be called only
        when all the objects have been generated (and it receives a
        list of objects, in the order given in doIdList).  The
        eachCallback is called as each object is generated, and
        receives only the object itself.

        If the objects already exist, the appropriate callback is
        called immediately.

        If all of the objects are not generated within the indicated
        timeout time, the timeoutCallback is called instead, with the
        original doIdList as the parameter.  If the timeoutCallback is
        None, then allCallback is called on timeout, with the list of
        objects that have been generated so far, and None for objects
        that have not been generated.

        If any element of doIdList is None or 0, it is ignored, and
        None is passed in its place in the object list passed to the
        callback.

        The return value may be saved and passed to a future call to
        abortRequest(), in order to abort a pending request before the
        timeout expires.

        Actually, you should be careful to call abortRequest() if you
        have made a call to requestObjects() that has not been resolved.
        To find examples, do a search for abortRequest() to find out
        how other code is using it.  A common idiom is to store the
        result from requestObjects() and call abortRequest() if delete()
        or destroy() is called on the requesting object.
