This package contains modules to quickly set up a Panda environment for
quick prototyping in the interactive Python shell.  Merely importing
one of these modules will create a :class:`.ShowBase` instance, opening
a graphical window and setting up the scene graph.

The most commonly used module from this package is :mod:`.DirectStart`,
importing which executes the following code::

   from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase
   base = ShowBase()
