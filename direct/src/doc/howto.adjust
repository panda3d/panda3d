                            HOWTO USE ADJUST()

What is adjust?  

BASIC:

Its a simple function that allows you to quickly pop up a slider to adjust
a value.  Example:

myVal = 0.0
def setMyVal(x):
   global myVal
   myVal = x
   print myVal

adjust(setMyVal)

this will print out the current value of the slider

ADVANCED:

You can use keyword arguments to configure the slider during or after
creation, or you can configure the slider interactively

Useful keywords include:

   min         # min value of the slider
   max         # max value of the slider
   resolution  # slider resolution
   text        # slider label

To set during creation call:

adjust(setMyVal, min = -10.0, max = 1000.0, resolution = 1.0, text = 'Fancy')

To set after creation:

es = adjust()
es['command'] = setMyVal
es['min'] = -1000.0
es['max'] = 10.0
es['resolution'] = 1.0
es['text'] = 'Fancy2'

To configure interactively, right click (mouse button 3) on various parts
of the slider to change settings.  Click on:

   from label -> to set min
   to label -> to set max
   slider -> to set resolution
   label -> to set slider label

You can pack multiple sliders into a single panel:

from tkinter import *

def func1(x):
   print '1:', x

def func2(x):
   print '2:', x

def func3(x):
   print '3:', x

tl = Toplevel()
tl.title('Fancy-multi-adjust')

adjust(func1, parent = tl, text = 'One')
adjust(func2, parent = tl, text = 'Two')
adjust(func3, parent = tl, text = 'Three')
