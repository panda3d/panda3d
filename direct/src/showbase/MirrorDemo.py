"""This file demonstrates one way to create a mirror effect in Panda.
Call setupMirror() to create a mirror in the world that reflects
everything in front of it.

The approach taken here is to create an offscreen buffer with its own
camera that renders its view into a texture, which is then applied to
the mirror geometry.  The mirror's camera is repositioned each frame
with a task to keep it always on the opposite side of the mirror from
the main camera.

This demonstrates the basic interface for offscreen
render-to-a-texture in Panda.  Similar approaches can be used for
related effects, such as a remote spy camera presenting its view onto
a closed-circuit television screen.

In this example the mirror itself is always perfectly flat--it's just
a single polygon, after all--but small distortions of the mirror
surface are possible, like a funhouse mirror.  However, the reflection
itself is always basically planar; for more accurate convex
reflections, you will need to use a sphere map or a cube map."""
