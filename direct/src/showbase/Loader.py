        """
        Attempts to load a model or models from one or more relative
        pathnames.  If the input modelPath is a string (a single model
        pathname), the return value will be a NodePath to the model
        loaded if the load was successful, or None otherwise.  If the
        input modelPath is a list of pathnames, the return value will
        be a list of NodePaths and/or Nones.

        loaderOptions may optionally be passed in to control details
        about the way the model is searched and loaded.  See the
        LoaderOptions class for more.

        The default is to look in the ModelPool (RAM) cache first, and
        return a copy from that if the model can be found there.  If
        the bam cache is enabled (via the model-cache-dir config
        variable), then that will be consulted next, and if both
        caches fail, the file will be loaded from disk.  If noCache is
        True, then neither cache will be consulted or updated.

        If allowInstance is True, a shared instance may be returned
        from the ModelPool.  This is dangerous, since it is easy to
        accidentally modify the shared instance, and invalidate future
        load attempts of the same model.  Normally, you should leave
        allowInstance set to False, which will always return a unique
        copy.

        If okMissing is True, None is returned if the model is not
        found or cannot be read, and no error message is printed.
        Otherwise, an IOError is raised if the model is not found or
        cannot be read (similar to attempting to open a nonexistent
        file).  (If modelPath is a list of filenames, then IOError is
        raised if *any* of the models could not be loaded.)

        If callback is not None, then the model load will be performed
        asynchronously.  In this case, loadModel() will initiate a
        background load and return immediately.  The return value will
        be an object that can be used to check the status, cancel the
        request, or use it in an `await` expression.  Unless callback
        is the special value True, when the requested model(s) have
        finished loading, it will be invoked with the n
        loaded models passed as its parameter list.  It is possible
        that the callback will be invoked immediately, even before
        loadModel() returns.  If you use callback, you may also
        specify a priority, which specifies the relative importance
        over this model over all of the other asynchronous load
        requests (higher numbers are loaded first).

        True asynchronous model loading requires Panda to have been
        compiled with threading support enabled (you can test
        Thread.isThreadingSupported()).  In the absence of threading
        support, the asynchronous interface still exists and still
        behaves exactly as described, except that loadModel() might
        not return immediately.

        """
        modelPath is a string.

        This loads a special model as a TextFont object, for rendering
        text with a TextNode.  A font file must be either a special
        egg file (or bam file) generated with egg-mkfont, which is
        considered a static font, or a standard font file (like a TTF
        file) that is supported by FreeType, which is considered a
        dynamic font.

        okMissing should be True to indicate the method should return
        None if the font file is not found.  If it is False, the
        method will raise an exception if the font file is not found
        or cannot be loaded.

        Most font-customization parameters accepted by this method
        (except lineHeight and spaceAdvance) may only be specified for
        dynamic font files like TTF files, not for static egg files.

        lineHeight specifies the vertical distance between consecutive
        lines, in Panda units.  If unspecified, it is taken from the
        font information.  This parameter may be specified for static
        as well as dynamic fonts.

        spaceAdvance specifies the width of a space character (ascii
        32), in Panda units.  If unspecified, it is taken from the
        font information.  This may be specified for static as well as
        dynamic fonts.

        The remaining parameters may only be specified for dynamic
        fonts.

        pixelsPerUnit controls the visual quality of the rendered text
        characters.  It specifies the number of texture pixels per
        each Panda unit of character height.  Increasing this number
        increases the amount of detail that can be represented in the
        characters, at the expense of texture memory.

        scaleFactor also controls the visual quality of the rendered
        text characters.  It is the amount by which the characters are
        rendered bigger out of Freetype, and then downscaled to fit
        within the texture.  Increasing this number may reduce some
        artifacts of very small font characters, at a small cost of
        processing time to generate the characters initially.

        textureMargin specifies the number of pixels of the texture to
        leave between adjacent characters.  It may be a floating-point
        number.  This helps reduce bleed-through from nearby
        characters within the texture space.  Increasing this number
        reduces artifacts at the edges of the character cells
        (especially for very small text scales), at the expense of
        texture memory.

        polyMargin specifies the amount of additional buffer to create
        in the polygon that represents each character, in Panda units.
        It is similar to textureMargin, but it controls the polygon
        buffer, not the texture buffer.  Increasing this number
        reduces artifacts from letters getting chopped off at the
        edges (especially for very small text scales), with some
        increasing risk of adjacent letters overlapping and obscuring
        each other.

        minFilter, magFilter, and anisotropicDegree specify the
        texture filter modes that should be applied to the textures
        that are created to hold the font characters.

        If color is not None, it should be a VBase4 specifying the
        foreground color of the font.  Specifying this option breaks
        TextNode.setColor(), so you almost never want to use this
        option; the default (white) is the most appropriate for a
        font, as it allows text to have any arbitrary color assigned
        at generation time.  However, if you want to use a colored
        outline (below) with a different color for the interior, for
        instance a yellow letter with a blue outline, then you need
        this option, and then *all* text generated with this font will
        have to be yellow and blue.

        If outlineWidth is nonzero, an outline will be created at
        runtime for the letters, and outlineWidth will be the desired
        width of the outline, in points (most fonts are 10 points
        high, so 0.5 is often a good choice).  If you specify
        outlineWidth, you can also specify outlineFeather (0.0 .. 1.0)
        and outlineColor.  You may need to increase pixelsPerUnit to
        get the best results.

        if renderMode is not None, it may be one of the following
        symbols to specify a geometry-based font:

            TextFont.RMTexture - this is the default.  Font characters
              are rendered into a texture and applied to a polygon.
              This gives the best general-purpose results.

            TextFont.RMWireframe - Font characters are rendered as a
              sequence of one-pixel lines.  Consider enabling line or
              multisample antialiasing for best results.

            TextFont.RMPolygon - Font characters are rendered as a
              flat polygon.  This works best for very large
              characters, and generally requires polygon or
              multisample antialiasing to be enabled for best results.

            TextFont.RMExtruded - Font characters are rendered with a
              3-D outline made of polygons, like a cookie cutter.
              This is appropriate for a 3-D scene, but may be
              completely invisible when assigned to a 2-D scene and
              viewed normally from the front, since polygons are
              infinitely thin.

            TextFont.RMSolid - A combination of RMPolygon and
              RMExtruded: a flat polygon in front with a solid
              three-dimensional edge.  This is best for letters that
              will be tumbling in 3-D space.

        If the texture mode is other than RMTexture, most of the above
        parameters do not apply, though pixelsPerUnit still does apply
        and roughly controls the tightness of the curve approximation
        (and the number of vertices generated).
