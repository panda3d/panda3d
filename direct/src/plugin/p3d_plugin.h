/* This file defines the C-level API to Panda's core plugin API.  This
   API is intended to provide basic functionality for loading and
   running Panda's .p3d files, particularly within a browser.

   This core API is intended to be loaded and run within a browser, as
   a standalone DLL.  It will in turn be responsible for fetching and
   installing the appropriate version of Panda and Python, as well as
   any required supporting libraries.

   Note that this code defines only the interface between the actual
   browser plugin and the Panda code.  It contains no code to directly
   interface with any browser.  The actual plugin itself will be a
   separate piece of code, written in ActiveX or NPAPI or whatever API
   is required for a given browser; and this code will be designed to
   download and link with this DLL.

   The browser or launching application will be referred to as the
   "host" in this documentation.  The host should load this core API
   DLL only once, but may then use it to create multiple simultaneous
   different instances of Panda windows.

   Filenames passed through this interface are in native OS-specific
   form, e.g. with a leading drive letter and backslashes, not in
   Panda's Unix-like form (except on Unix-based OSes, of course).

/************************ GLOBAL FUNCTIONS **************************/

/* The following interfaces are global to the core API space, as
   opposed to being specific to a particular instance. */

/* This is passed for verify_contents, below. */
typedef enum {
  P3D_VC_none,
  P3D_VC_normal,
  P3D_VC_force,
  P3D_VC_never,
} P3D_verify_contents;

/* This function should be called immediately after the core API is
   loaded.  You should pass P3D_API_VERSION as the first parameter, so
   the DLL can verify that it has been built with the same version of
   the API as the host.

   The contents_filename, if not NULL or empty, names a contents.xml
   file that has already been downloaded and verified from the server.
   If this is NULL, a new file will be downloaded as needed.

   If host_url is not NULL or empty, it specifies the root URL of
   the download server that provided the contents_filename.

   If verify_contents is P3D_VC_none, then the server will not be
   contacted unless the current contents.xml cannot be read at all.
   If it is P3D_VC_normal, the server will be contacted whenever the
   contents.xml has expired.  If it is P3D_VC_force, each server will
   be contacted initially in all cases, and subseqeuntly only whenever
   contents.xml has expired for that server.  The opposite of
   P3D_VC_force is P3D_VC_never, which forces the plugin never to
   contact the server and not to verify the contents at all.  This
   option should only be used if the host directory is prepopulated.
   Normally, a web plugin should set this to P3D_VC_normal.

   If platform is not NULL or empty, it specifies the current platform
   string; otherwise, the compiled-in default is used.  This should
   generally be left at NULL.

   If log_directory is not NULL or empty, it specifies the directory
   into which all log files will be written; otherwise, the
   compiled-in default will be used, or the system temp directory if
   no default is compiled in.

   If log_basename is not NULL or empty, it specifies the filename in
   log_directory to which the core API's logfile output will be
   written.  Otherwise, the compiled-in default is used; if there is
   no compiled-in default, no logfile output will be generated by the
   core API.  Note that the individual instances also have their own
   log_basename values.  If log_history is greater than zero, the
   most recent log_history (count) logs generated (per log_basename)
   will be retained on disk, each named uniquely by appending a 
   timestamp to the log_basename before file creation.

   Next, trusted_environment should be set true to indicate that the
   environment and p3d file are already trusted.  If this is set, the
   p3d file will be run without checking its signature.  Normally, a
   browser plugin should set this false.

   Furthermore, console_environment should be set true to indicate that
   we are running within a text-based console, and expect to preserve
   the current working directory, and also see standard output, or false
   to indicate that we are running within a GUI environment, and
   expect none of these.  Normally, a browser plugin should set this
   false.

   Finally, root_dir and host_dir can be set to override the default
   root and package directories.  Normally, you don't need to set them.

   This function returns true if the core API is valid and uses a
   compatible API, false otherwise.  If it returns false, the host
   should not call any more functions in this API, and should
   immediately unload the DLL and (if possible) download a new one. */

   callback function, P3D_request_ready (above), which may be called
   asynchronously by the core API.  The host should be careful that
   this callback function is protected from mutual access.  The
   callback function implementation may be as simple as setting a flag
   that the host will later check within its main processing loop.

   Once P3D_request_ready() has been received, the host should call
   P3D_instance_get_request() to query the nature of the request.
   This call may be made synchronously, i.e. within the host's main
   processing loop.  After each request is serviced, the host should
   release the request via P3D_request_finish() and then call
   P3D_instance_get_request() again until that function returns NULL.
