"""
This package contains the Python implementation of the interval system,
which is a mechanism for playing back scripted actions.  A range of
interval types has been defined to automate motion, animation, sounds,
color, function calls, as well as other intervals and arbitrary
properties.

All interval types can be conveniently imported from the
:mod:`.IntervalGlobal` module::

   from direct.interval.IntervalGlobal import *

For more information about intervals, see the :ref:`intervals` manual page.
