/**
 * This class is similar to ConfigVariable, but it reports its value as a list
 * of strings.  In this special case, all of the declarations of the variable
 * are returned as the elements of this list, in order.
 *
 * Note that this is different from a normal ConfigVariableString, which just
 * returns its topmost value, which can optionally be treated as a number of
 * discrete words by dividing it at the spaces.
 *
 * A ConfigVariableList cannot be modified locally.
