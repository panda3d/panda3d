 * The Maya conversion server listens for incoming requests to

 * This server listens to port 4242 after being started with
 * egg2maya -server or maya2egg -server.
 *
 * Use egg2maya_client and maya2egg_client as a replacement for
 * the egg2maya and maya2egg utilities after starting the server.
 *
 * Very useful in case you need to batch convert models.
 * The regular utilities can only convert one model at a time.
