/**
 * This class serves as a plug-in to Maya to save the scene and view it using
 * the external pview program, rather than linking in any part of Panda to a
 * Maya plugin.
 *
 * Since it does not link with any Panda code, and hence is a very lean
 * plugin, it is less likely than MayaPview to cause interoperability problems
 * within Maya.  However, it does force a save-to-disk and a spawning of a
 * separate executable, including a complete reloading of all of the Maya
 * libraries, so it is quite a bit slower to execute.  And the potential for
 * interactive control is substantially reduced.
