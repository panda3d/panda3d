// This header file defines a few things that are necessary to define before

// about the compiler.  It must not try to protect itself from multiple
// inclusion with #ifdef .. #endif, since it must be used each time it is
// included.

// Maya 2008 will declare some VS2005-specific hacks unless we define this.

// Old versions of Maya, before version 5.0, used <iosteam.h> etc.  instead of
// the new <iostream> headers.  This requires some workarounds to make this
// work compatibly with Panda, which uses the new headers.

// In windows, the antiquated headers define completely unrelated (and
// incompatible) classes from those declared in the new headers.  On the other
// hand, in gcc the antiquated headers seem to be references to the new
// template classes, so under gcc we also have to declare typedefs to make
// this work.

// work just fine on Windows, obviating the need for sneaky #defines in this
// and in post_maya_include.h.
