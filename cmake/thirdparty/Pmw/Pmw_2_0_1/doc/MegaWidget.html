<dt> <h3>Description</h3></dt><dd>
<p>
    This class creates a megawidget contained within a Tkinter.Frame
    window.  The class acts as the base class for megawidgets that are
    not contained in their own toplevel window, such as <a href="ButtonBox.html">Pmw.ButtonBox</a> and
    <a href="ComboBox.html">Pmw.ComboBox</a>.  It creates a Tkinter.Frame component, named <strong>hull</strong>,
    to act as the container of the megawidget.  The window class name
    for the <strong>hull</strong> widget is set to the most-specific class name for
    the megawidget.  Derived classes specialise this class by
    creating other widget components as children of the <strong>hull</strong> widget.</p>

This acts as the body for the entire megawidget.  Other components
    are created as children of the hull to further specialise this
    class. By default, this component is a Tkinter.Frame.</p>

In addition, methods from the
