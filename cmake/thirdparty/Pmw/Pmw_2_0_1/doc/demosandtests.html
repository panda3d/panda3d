  Pmw comes with an extensive range of demonstrations and tests.  The
  demonstrations can be used to get a feel for what is provided by Pmw
  and the demonstration code can be viewed to see examples of how to
  use Pmw.  The tests can be executed to check that there are no
  problems with running Pmw in your environment.

<p>
  The Pmw <code>demos</code> directory contains demonstration scripts
  showing many of the features of Pmw megawidgets.  To view a
  comprehensive package of all the demonstrations, including a view of
  the source code, run the <code>All.py</code> script.  Run
  <code>All.py -help</code> for a short description of the script's
  options.

<p>
  All of the demonstrations may also be run separately.  Most of the
  demonstrations show some of the features of one of the Pmw
  megawidgets.  For example, to see a demonstration of the ButtonBox
  megawidget, change into the <code>demos</code> directory and
  run

<b>Creating demonstrations of new megawidgets</b>
<br>
<p>
If you create a new megawidget you can create a demonstration for it
by using the file
<a href="ExampleDemo.py"><code>ExampleDemo.py</code></a> as a
template.  This template allows the demonstration to be run
individually or to be automatically included as part of the
demonstration package <code>All.py</code>.  You should take a copy of
the template and name the new file after your megawidget.  You should
then replace each instance of the word <code>EXAMPLE</code> with the
name of your megawidget and replace the code in the
<code>__init__</code> method with code to create and initialise one or
more instances of your megawidget, which should be a child of
<code>parent</code>.  You can add other methods as necessary.

</p>

</dd>
<dt> <h2>Tests</h2></dt><dd>
<p>
  The Pmw <code>tests</code> directory contains a test framework
  and a set of test scripts for Pmw.
  The tests cover the standard Tkinter module and most of the Pmw megawidgets.
  The tests make a great
  demonstration of the flexibility of the megawidgets.  Simply change
  into the <code>tests</code> directory and run
  <code>python All.py</code>.

<p>
  If all tests pass there should be no output printed to standard
  output.  If any of the tests fail, please send the test output to
  the maintainer at
  <a href="mailto:gregm@iname.com"><i>gregm@iname.com</i></a>.

</p>

<p>
  All of the tests may be run separately.  Most of the tests test the
  features of one of the Pmw megawidgets.  For example, to execute the
  test for the ButtonBox megawidget, run

</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
python ButtonBox_test.py
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The Test.py file contains general testing functions and is imported
  by all test files.
  Other files, which test other features of Pmw include
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
Blt_test.py           BLT vector and graph interface
Colors_test.py        setting color schemes
MegaWidget_test.py    creation of megawidget classes
Options_test.py       option and component handling
PmwBase_test.py       more option and component handling
Tkinter_test.py       Tk widgets in the Tkinter module
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<b>Creating tests for new megawidgets</b>
<br>
<p>
If you create a new megawidget you should create a test for it.  There
is no template file for creating tests, but by looking at the other
Pmw tests (for example,
<a href="ScrolledText_test.py"><code>ScrolledText_test.py</code></a>) you
will get some idea of how to create a test for your megawidget.

</p>

<p>
The test files are designed to be run both individually or
automatically by the test package <code>All.py</code>.  Each test file
must define the <code>testData</code> tuple.  This consists of a
sequence of 2-element tuples, each tuple being a test specification
for one megawidget.  Usually a file tests only one megawidget and so
there is only one test specification.  The first element in the
specification is the megawidget class and the second is a sequence of
(yet more) 2-element tuples.  In each of these tuples, the first
element is a sequence of individual tests to perform on an instance of
the megawidget and the second element is a dictionary to use for
the keyword arguments when creating the instance.  Each individual
test is a tuple, the meaning of which depends on the type of the first
element, which may be either a string, a function or a method of the
megawidget class, as explained below.

</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
If the first element is a string, then it is treated as an option of
the megawidget and configure() is called to set the option to the
value specified by the second element.  After setting the option,
cget() is called to query the option.  If the test tuple has three
elements, then the value returned by cget() must equal the value
specified by the third element.  Otherwise, the value returned must
equal the value specified by the second element. For example,

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
('vscrollmode', 'static'),
('text_relief', 'sunken'),
('vscrollmode', 'bogus', 'ValueError: bad vscrollmode ' +
  'option "bogus": should be static, dynamic, or none'),
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>
<li>
<p>
If the first element is a function or method, then the function or
method is called.  The arguments to the call are given by the second
element.  (As a special case, if the second element is not a tuple, it
is used as the only argument to the call.) The test tuple may have 2,
3 or 4 elements.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If it has two elements, then the value returned by the call must be
None.  For example,

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
(c.exportfile, '/tmp/ScrolledText_test.py'),
(os.unlink, '/tmp/ScrolledText_test.py'),
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>
<li>
<p>
If it has four elements, then the third element is a dictionary to use
for the keyword arguments in the call and the value returned by the
call must equal the value specified by the fourth element.  For
example,

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
(c.search, ('abc', '0.0'), {'nocase': 1}, '2.24'),
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>
<li>
<p>
If is has three elements and the third element is a dictionary, then
it is used for the keyword arguments in the call and the value
returned by the call must be None.  For example

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
(c.configurepane, 'first', {'size' : 200}),
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>
<li>
<p>
If is has three elements and the third element is not a dictionary,
then the value returned by the call must equal the value specified by
the third element.  For example,

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
(c.components, (), ['hull', 'label']),
(c.add, ('Legumes',),
  'ValueError: name "Legumes" already exists'),
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some special functions and values supplied by the Test module that may
be used in the tests include:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
Test.callback       callback taking no arguments
Test.callback1      callback taking one argument
Test.callbackN      callback taking any number of arguments

Test.currentWidget  returns the widget instance being tested
Test.num_options    returns number of options for the widget

Test.earthris       a sample Tkinter.PhotoImage
Test.flagup         a sample Tkinter.BitmapImage
Test.floatvar       a Tkinter.DoubleVar
Test.stringvar      a Tkinter.StringVar
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  To slow down a test (to see what is being displayed), add the
  following line which sets the delay between tests to (say) 1000
  milliseconds:

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
Test.setdelay(1000)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  To print information about what is being tested, add the line:

</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<pre>
Test.setverbose(1)
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
</dl>
