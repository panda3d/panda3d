# Uncomment one of the following lines to choose whether you should
# run using OpenGL, DirectX or TinyPanda (software) rendering.
# There can only be one load-display line, but you can use
# multiple aux-display lines to specify fallback modules.
# When the module indicated by load-display fails, it will fall
# back to the next display module indicated by aux-display,
# when that fails, the next aux-display line, and so on.

load-display pandagl
#load-display pandadx9
#load-display pandagles
#load-display p3tinydisplay

# These control the placement and size of the default rendering window.
# A value of -2 for the origin means to center it on the screen,
# while -1 lets the window manager choose the position.

# The framebuffer-hardware flag forces it to use an accelerated driver.
# The framebuffer-software flag forces it to use a software renderer.
# If you don't set either, it will use whatever's available.

# These set the minimum requirements for the framebuffer.

# consistent with the other framebuffer requirements.

# These control the amount of output Panda gives for some various
# categories.  The severity levels, in order, are "spam", "debug",
# "info", "warning", and "error"; the default is "info".  Uncomment
# one (or define a new one for the particular category you wish to
# change) to control this output.
