    wx.ScrolledWindow, providing automatic scrollbar and scrolling

    to do this, but is now available for general use as a proper class
    (and the demo is now converted to just use it.)

    It is assumed that the ScrolledPanel will have a sizer, as it is
    used to calculate the minimal virtual size of the panel and etc.
