This is FreeType 2.5.01, downloaded from:
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/ft2501.zip

Compiled in Release mode using the supplied vc2010 sln on Windows 7.
I had to add a configuration for x64 to the project.
lib/freetype.lib was compiled as freetype250.lib.

FreeType is licensed permissively, however, its use must be mentioned in product documentation,
or you may choose to use FreeType under the terms of the GPLv2 instead.
