This is libpng 1.6.3, downloaded from:
http://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/lpng163.zip
Built in Release mode using CMake 2.8.11.2, MSVC 2010 Express and WinSDK 7.1.

I copied libpng16_static.lib to libpng_static.lib for easier upgrading later.

I pointed ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR and ZLIB_LIBRARY to the location of the zlib
thirdparty pcakage.  I disabled PNG_SHARED since we want a static only build.

Don't forget to copy pnglibconf.h from the CMake build directory.
