This is libtiff 4.0.3, downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/tiff-4.0.3.zip
Built using Visual C++ 2010 Express and Windows SDK 7.1 on Windows 7.

First edit nmake.opt as such:
JPEG_SUPPORT	= 1
JPEGDIR 	= c:/cygwin/home/rdb/panda3d/thirdparty/win-libs-vc10-x64/jpeg
JPEG_INCLUDE	= -I$(JPEGDIR)/include
JPEG_LIB 	=

ZIP_SUPPORT	= 1
ZLIBDIR 	= c:/cygwin/home/rdb/panda3d/thirdparty/win-libs-vc10-x64/zlib
ZLIB_INCLUDE	= -I$(ZLIBDIR)/include
ZLIB_LIB 	=

Then build on the Windows SDK 7.1 Command Prompt as follows:
nmake /f makefile.vc

(We don't let it link with the zlib and jpeg libraries because it would
otherwise unnecessarily include them in libtiff.lib.  This means that it'll
error out when compiling libtiff.dll, but at that point, it has already
compiled libtiff.lib, which is the one we need.)
