1.10
* Iterative cluster fit is now considered to be a new compression mode
* The core cluster fit is now 4x faster using contributions by Ignacio
Castano from NVIDIA
* The single colour lookup table has been halved by exploiting symmetry

1.9
* Added contributed SSE1 truncate implementation
* Changed use of SQUISH_USE_SSE to be 1 for SSE and 2 for SSE2 instructions
* Cluster fit is now iterative to further reduce image error

1.8
* Switched from using floor to trunc for much better SSE performance (again)
* Xcode build now expects libpng in /usr/local for extra/squishpng

1.7
* Fixed floating-point equality issue in clusterfit sort (x86 affected only)
* Implemented proper SSE(2) floor function for 50% speedup on SSE builds 
* The range fit implementation now uses the correct colour metric

1.6
* Fixed bug in CompressImage where masked pixels were not skipped over
* DXT3 and DXT5 alpha compression now properly use the mask to ignore pixels
* Fixed major DXT1 bug that can generate unexpected transparent pixels

1.5
* Added CompressMasked function to handle incomplete DXT blocks more cleanly
* Added kWeightColourByAlpha flag for better quality images when alpha blending

1.4
* Fixed stack overflow in rangefit

1.3
* Worked around SSE floor implementation bug, proper fix needed!
* This release has visual studio and makefile builds that work

1.2
* Added provably optimal single colour compressor
* Added extra/squishgen.cpp that generates single colour lookup tables

1.1
* Fixed a DXT1 colour output bug
* Changed argument order for Decompress function to match Compress
* Added GetStorageRequirements function
* Added CompressImage function
* Added DecompressImage function
* Moved squishtool.cpp to extra/squishpng.cpp
* Added extra/squishtest.cpp

1.0
* Initial release
