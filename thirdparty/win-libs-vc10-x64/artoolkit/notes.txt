This is ARToolKit 2.72.1, downloaded from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/artoolkit/files/artoolkit/2.72.1/ARToolKit-2.72.1.tgz
Compiled in Release mode using Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7, using the supplied .sln.
I had to create another build configuration to make it compile for x64.
I've only built libAR, as that's the only library we use.

Configure.win32.bat must be run first, to generate the AR/config.h header file.
