This is Bullet 2.81, downloaded from:
https://bullet.googlecode.com/files/bullet-2.81-rev2613.zip
Built in Release mode using the supplied VS2010 solution.

There was no supplied include dir, so I had to copy the src
directory recursively and remove all non-header files.

The .lib files were stripped of their suffices except for _x64.

License is permissive (ZLib license).
