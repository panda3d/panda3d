This is FFmpeg git-920046a (2013-08-21), downloaded from:
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/shared/ffmpeg-20130821-git-920046a-win64-shared.7z
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/dev/ffmpeg-20130821-git-920046a-win64-dev.7z

Compiled in GPLv3 mode, apparently.  Licenses can be found in the licenses directory.  (Phoo!  Have fun reading.)

This also includes inttypes.h from https://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/ (r29).
(stdint.h would also have to be copied for MSVC versions before 2010.)

I regenerated the .lib files using the following commands:
lib /def:avcodec-55.def /out:avcodec.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:avdevice-55.def /out:avdevice.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:avformat-55.def /out:avformat.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:avutil-52.def /out:avutil.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:postproc-52.def /out:postproc.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:swscale-2.def /out:swscale.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:swresample-0.def /out:swresample.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:avfilter-3.def /out:avfilter.lib /machine:x64
This is necessary to allow linking from VC2010.
