.SH NAME
softcvs \- prepare a SoftImage database directory for adding to CVS
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsoftcvs\fR [opts]
.SH DESCRIPTION
softcvs is designed to prepare a directory hierarchy representing a SoftImage database for adding to CVS.  First, it eliminates SoftImage's silly filename\-based versioning system by renaming versioned filenames higher than 1\-0 back to version 1\-0.  Then, it rolls up all the files for each scene except the texture images into a Panda multifile, which is added to CVS; the texture images are directly added to CVS where they are.
.PP
The reduction of hundreds of SoftImage files per scene down to one multifile and a handle of texture images should greatly improve the update and commit times of CVS.
.PP
You must run this from within the root of a SoftImage database directory; e.g. the directory that contains SCENES, PICTURES, MODELS, and so on.
