.SH NAME
egg-trans \- apply transformations and optimizations to an .egg file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBegg-trans\fR [opts] -o output.egg input.egg
.br
\fBegg-trans\fR [opts] input.egg >output.egg
.SH DESCRIPTION
egg\-trans reads an egg file and writes an essentially equivalent egg file to the standard output, or to the file specified with \-o.  Some simple operations on the egg file are supported.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-noabs
Don't allow the input egg file to have absolute pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option is designed to help detect errors when populating or building a standalone model tree, which should be self-contained and include only relative pathnames.
.TP
.B \-F
Flatten out transforms.
.TP
.B \-t
Apply texture matrices to UV's.
.TP
.B \-T
Collapse equivalent texture references.
.TP
.B \-c
Clean out degenerate polygons and unused vertices.
.TP
.B \-C
Clean out higher-order polygons by subdividing into triangles.
.TP
.B \-mesh
Mesh triangles into triangle strips.  This is mainly useful as a tool to visualize the work that the mesher will do, since triangles are automatically meshed whenever an egg file is loaded.  Note that, unlike the automatic meshing at load time, you are must ensure that you do not start out with multiple triangles with different attributes (e.g. texture) together in the same group.
.TP
.B \-N
Standardize and uniquify group names.
.TP
.BI "\-ct " "threshold"
Implies -c, but sets the threshold for determining whether two vertex positions are equivalent.  A higher value here may be used to merge adjacent vertices together, and an even higher value can be used to reduce the density of a model.
.TP
.BI "\-pr " "path_replace"
Sometimes references to other files (textures, external references) are stored with a full path that is appropriate for some other system, but does not exist here.  This option may be used to specify how those invalid paths map to correct paths.  Generally, this is of the form 'orig_prefix=replacement_prefix', which indicates a particular initial sequence of characters that should be replaced with a new sequence; e.g. '/c/home/models=/beta/fish'.  If the replacement prefix does not begin with a slash, the file will then be searched for along the search path specified by -pp.  You may use standard filename matching characters ('*', '?', etc.) in the original prefix, and '**' as a component by itself stands for any number of components.

This option may be repeated as necessary; each file will be tried against each specified method, in the order in which they appear in the command line, until the file is found.  If the file is not found, the last matching prefix is used anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-pp " "dirname"
Adds the indicated directory name to the list of directories to search for filenames referenced by the source file.  This is used only for relative paths, or for paths that are made relative by a -pr replacement string that doesn't begin with a leading slash.  The model-path is always implicitly searched anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-ps " "path_store"
Specifies the way an externally referenced file is to be represented in the resulting output file.  This assumes the named filename actually exists; see -pr to indicate how to deal with external references that have bad pathnames.  This option will not help you to find a missing file, but simply controls how filenames are represented in the output.

The option may be one of: rel, abs, rel_abs, strip, or keep.  If either rel or rel_abs is specified, the files are made relative to the directory specified by -pd.  The default is rel.
.TP
.BI "\-pd " "path_directory"
Specifies the name of a directory to make paths relative to, if '-ps rel' or '-ps rel_abs' is specified.  If this is omitted, the directory name is taken from the name of the output file.
.TP
.BI "\-pc " "target_directory"
Copies textures and other dependent files into the indicated directory.  If a relative pathname is specified, it is relative to the directory specified with -pd, above.
.TP
.BI "\-td " "dirname"
Copy textures to the indicated directory.  The copy is performed only if the destination file does not exist or is older than the source file.
.TP
.BI "\-te " "ext"
Rename textures to have the indicated extension.  This also automatically copies them to the new filename (possibly in a different directory if -td is also specified), and may implicitly convert to a different image format according to the extension.
.TP
.BI "\-tt " "type"
Explicitly specifies the image format to convert textures to when copying them via -td or -te.  Normally, this is unnecessary as the image format can be determined by the extension, but sometimes the extension is insufficient to unambiguously specify an image type.
.TP
.BI "\-delod " "dist"
Eliminate LOD's by choosing the level that would be appropriate for a camera at the indicated fixed distance from each LOD.  Use -delod -1 to keep all the LOD's as they are, which is the default.

.TP
.B \-no
Strip all normals.
.TP
.B \-np
Strip existing normals and redefine polygon normals.
.TP
.BI "\-nv " "threshold"
Strip existing normals and redefine vertex normals.  Consider an edge between adjacent polygons to be smooth if the angle between them is less than threshold degrees.
.TP
.B \-nn
Preserve normals exactly as they are.  This is the default.
.TP
.BI "\-tbn " "name"
Compute tangent and binormal for the named texture coordinate set(s).  The name may include wildcard characters such as * and ?.  The normal must already exist or have been computed via one of the above options.  The tangent and binormal are used to implement bump mapping and related texture-based lighting effects.  This option may be repeated as necessary to name multiple texture coordinate sets.
.TP
.B \-tbnall
Compute tangent and binormal for all texture coordinate sets.  This is equivalent to -tbn "*".
.TP
.B \-tbnauto
Compute tangent and binormal for all normal maps. 
.TP
.BI "\-TS " "sx[,sy,sz]"
Scale the model uniformly by the given factor (if only one number is given) or in each axis by sx, sy, sz (if three numbers are given).
.TP
.BI "\-TR " "x,y,z"
Rotate the model x degrees about the x axis, then y degrees about the y axis, and then z degrees about the z axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TA " "angle,x,y,z"
Rotate the model angle degrees counterclockwise about the given axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TT " "x,y,z"
Translate the model by the indicated amount.

All transformation options (-TS, -TR, -TA, -TT) are cumulative and are applied in the order they are encountered on the command line.
.TP
.BI "\-o " "filename"
Specify the filename to which the resulting egg file will be written.  If this option is omitted, the egg file is written to standard output.
.TP
.BI "\-cs " "coordinate-system"
Specify the coordinate system of the resulting egg file.  This may be one of 'y-up', 'z-up', 'y-up-left', or 'z-up-left'.  The default is the same coordinate system as the input egg file.  If this is different from the input egg file, a conversion will be performed.
.TP
.B \-f
Force complete loading: load up the egg file along with all of its external references.
.TP
.B \-h
