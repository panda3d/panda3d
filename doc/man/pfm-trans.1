.SH NAME
pfm-trans \- transform .pfm files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
pfm\-trans reads an pfm file and transforms it, filters it, operates on it, writing the output to another pfm file.  A pfm file contains a 2\-d table of floating\-point values.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-z
Treats (0,0,0) in the pfm file as a special don't-touch value.
.TP
.BI "\-nan " "num_channels"
Treats a NaN in any of the first num_channels channels as a special don't-touch value.
.TP
.BI "\-resize " "width,height"
Resamples the pfm file to scale it to the indicated grid size.  A simple box filter is applied during the scale.  Don't confuse this with -TS, which scales the individual point values, but doesn't change the number of points.
.TP
.BI "\-crop " "xbegin,xend,ybegin,yend"
Crops the pfm file to the indicated subregion.
.TP
.B \-autocrop
Automatically crops to the smallest possible rectangle that includes all points.  Requires -z or -nan.
.TP
.BI "\-rotate " "degrees"
Rotates the pfm file the specified number of degrees counterclockwise, which must be a multiple of 90.
.TP
.B \-mirror_x
Flips the pfm file about the x axis.
.TP
.B \-mirror_y
Flips the pfm file about the y axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TS " "sx[,sy,sz]"
Scale the model uniformly by the given factor (if only one number is given) or in each axis by sx, sy, sz (if three numbers are given).
.TP
.BI "\-TR " "x,y,z"
Rotate the model x degrees about the x axis, then y degrees about the y axis, and then z degrees about the z axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TA " "angle,x,y,z"
Rotate the model angle degrees counterclockwise about the given axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TT " "x,y,z"
Translate the model by the indicated amount.

All transformation options (-TS, -TR, -TA, -TT) are cumulative and are applied in the order they are encountered on the command line.
.TP
.BI "\-o " "filename"
Specify the filename to which the resulting pfm file will be written.  This is only valid when there is only one input pfm file on the command line.  If you want to process multiple files simultaneously, you must use -d.
.TP
.BI "\-d " "dirname"
Specify the name of the directory in which to write the processed pfm files.  If you are processing only one pfm file, this may be omitted in lieu of the -o option.
.TP
.BI "\-vis " "filename.bam"
Generates a bam file that represents a visualization of the pfm file as a 3-D geometric mesh.  If -vistex is specified, the mesh is textured.
.TP
.B \-visinv
Inverts the visualization, generating a uniform 2-d mesh with the 3-d depth values encoded in the texture coordinates.
.TP
.B \-vis2d
Respect only the first two components of each depth value, ignoring z.
.TP
.BI "\-vistex " "texture.jpg"
Specifies the name of the texture to apply to the visualization.
.TP
.BI "\-ls " "filename.txt"
Lists the points in the file to the indicated text file.
.TP
.B \-h
