.B p3dcparse -h
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reads one or more DC files, which are used to describe the
communication channels in the distributed class system.  By default,
the file(s) are read and concatenated, and a single hash code is printed
corresponding to the file's contents.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Writes a complete parseable version of the file to standard
output instead of printing a hash code.
.TP
.B \-b
Writes a brief parseable version of the file instead of a full
version.  This is semantically the same as the output produced
the above \fB\-v\fP option--reading it would produce exactly the
same results--but it is designed to be slightly obfuscated.  The
comments and parameter names are not included.
.TP
.B \-c
Write a list of class names, showing the inheritance hierarchy.
Some class names will be listed twice in the presence of multiple
inheritance.
.TP
.B \-f
Write a complete list of field names available for each class,
including all inherited fields.
