.SH NAME
egg-list-textures \- list textures referenced by an .egg file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBegg-list-textures\fR [opts] input.egg
.SH DESCRIPTION
egg\-list\-textures reads an egg file and writes a list of the textures it references.  It is particularly useful for building up the textures.txa file used for egg\-palettize, since the output format is crafted to be compatible with that file's input format.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-noabs
Don't allow the input egg file to have absolute pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option is designed to help detect errors when populating or building a standalone model tree, which should be self-contained and include only relative pathnames.
.TP
.BI "\-cs " "coordinate-system"
Specify the coordinate system to operate in.  This may be  one of 'y-up', 'z-up', 'y-up-left', or 'z-up-left'.  The default is the coordinate system of the input egg file.
.TP
.B \-f
Force complete loading: load up the egg file along with all of its external references.
.TP
.B \-h
