.TH EGG-CROP 1 "27 December 2014" "1.9.0" Panda3D
.SH NAME
egg-crop \- crop geometry in an .egg file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBegg-crop\fR [opts] -o output.egg input.egg
.br
\fBegg-crop\fR [opts] input.egg >output.egg
.SH DESCRIPTION
egg\-crop strips out all parts of an egg file that fall outside of an arbitrary bounding volume, specified with a minimum and maximum point in world coordinates.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-noabs
Don't allow the input egg file to have absolute pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option is designed to help detect errors when populating or building a standalone model tree, which should be self-contained and include only relative pathnames.
.TP
.BI "\-min " "x,y,z"
Specify the minimum point.
.TP
.BI "\-max " "x,y,z"
Specify the maximum point.
.TP
.BI "\-o " "filename"
Specify the filename to which the resulting egg file will be written.  If this option is omitted, the egg file is written to standard output.
.TP
.BI "\-cs " "coordinate-system"
Specify the coordinate system of the resulting egg file.  This may be one of 'y-up', 'z-up', 'y-up-left', or 'z-up-left'.  The default is the same coordinate system as the input egg file.  If this is different from the input egg file, a conversion will be performed.
.TP
.B \-f
Force complete loading: load up the egg file along with all of its external references.
