.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts Lightwave Object (.lwo) files to egg.  Many rendering characteristics of Lightwave (like layered shaders, etc.) are not supported, but fundamental things like polygons and texture maps are.  This program is primarily designed to support files written by Lightwave version 6.x (LWO2 files), but it also has some limited support for version 5.x files (LWOB files).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-noabs
Don't allow the input Lightwave file to have absolute pathnames.  If it does, abort with an error.  This option is designed to help detect errors when populating or building a standalone model tree, which should be self-contained and include only relative pathnames.
.TP
.B \-noexist
Don't treat it as an error if the input file references pathnames (e.g. textures) that don't exist.  Normally, this will be flagged as an error and the command aborted; with this option, an egg file will be generated anyway, referencing pathnames that do not exist.
.TP
.B \-ignore
Ignore non-fatal errors and generate an egg file anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-pr " "path_replace"
Sometimes references to other files (textures, external references) are stored with a full path that is appropriate for some other system, but does not exist here.  This option may be used to specify how those invalid paths map to correct paths.  Generally, this is of the form 'orig_prefix=replacement_prefix', which indicates a particular initial sequence of characters that should be replaced with a new sequence; e.g. '/c/home/models=/beta/fish'.  If the replacement prefix does not begin with a slash, the file will then be searched for along the search path specified by -pp.  You may use standard filename matching characters ('*', '?', etc.) in the original prefix, and '**' as a component by itself stands for any number of components.

This option may be repeated as necessary; each file will be tried against each specified method, in the order in which they appear in the command line, until the file is found.  If the file is not found, the last matching prefix is used anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-pp " "dirname"
Adds the indicated directory name to the list of directories to search for filenames referenced by the source file.  This is used only for relative paths, or for paths that are made relative by a -pr replacement string that doesn't begin with a leading slash.  The model-path is always implicitly searched anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-ps " "path_store"
Specifies the way an externally referenced file is to be represented in the resulting output file.  This assumes the named filename actually exists; see -pr to indicate how to deal with external references that have bad pathnames.  This option will not help you to find a missing file, but simply controls how filenames are represented in the output.

The option may be one of: rel, abs, rel_abs, strip, or keep.  If either rel or rel_abs is specified, the files are made relative to the directory specified by -pd.  The default is rel.
.TP
.BI "\-pd " "path_directory"
Specifies the name of a directory to make paths relative to, if '-ps rel' or '-ps rel_abs' is specified.  If this is omitted, the directory name is taken from the name of the output file.
.TP
.BI "\-pc " "target_directory"
Copies textures and other dependent files into the indicated directory.  If a relative pathname is specified, it is relative to the directory specified with -pd, above.
.TP
.BI "\-ui " "units"
Specify the units of the input Lightwave file.  By convention, this is assumed to be meters if it is unspecified.
.TP
.BI "\-uo " "units"
Specify the units of the resulting egg file.  If this is specified, the vertices in the egg file will be scaled as necessary to make the appropriate units conversion; otherwise, the vertices will be left as they are.
.TP
.B \-no
Strip all normals.
.TP
.B \-np
Strip existing normals and redefine polygon normals.
.TP
.BI "\-nv " "threshold"
Strip existing normals and redefine vertex normals.  Consider an edge between adjacent polygons to be smooth if the angle between them is less than threshold degrees.
.TP
.B \-nn
Preserve normals exactly as they are.  This is the default.
.TP
.BI "\-tbn " "name"
Compute tangent and binormal for the named texture coordinate set(s).  The name may include wildcard characters such as * and ?.  The normal must already exist or have been computed via one of the above options.  The tangent and binormal are used to implement bump mapping and related texture-based lighting effects.  This option may be repeated as necessary to name multiple texture coordinate sets.
.TP
.B \-tbnall
Compute tangent and binormal for all texture coordinate sets.  This is equivalent to -tbn "*".
.TP
.B \-tbnauto
Compute tangent and binormal for all normal maps. 
.TP
.BI "\-TS " "sx[,sy,sz]"
Scale the model uniformly by the given factor (if only one number is given) or in each axis by sx, sy, sz (if three numbers are given).
.TP
.BI "\-TR " "x,y,z"
Rotate the model x degrees about the x axis, then y degrees about the y axis, and then z degrees about the z axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TA " "angle,x,y,z"
Rotate the model angle degrees counterclockwise about the given axis.
.TP
.BI "\-TT " "x,y,z"
Translate the model by the indicated amount.

All transformation options (-TS, -TR, -TA, -TT) are cumulative and are applied in the order they are encountered on the command line.
.TP
.BI "\-o " "filename"
Specify the filename to which the resulting egg file will be written.  If this option is omitted, the last parameter name is taken to be the name of the output file, or standard output is used if there are no other parameters.
.TP
.BI "\-cs " "coordinate-system"
Specify the coordinate system of the input Lightwave file.  Normally, this is y-up-left.
.TP
.B \-h
