.SH NAME
fltcopy \- copy MultiGen .flt files into a CVS source hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfltcopy\fR [opts] file.flt [file.flt ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
fltcopy copies one or more MultiGen .flt files into a CVS source hierarchy.  Rather than copying the named files immediately into the current directory, it first scans the entire source hierarchy, identifying all the already\-existing files.  If the named file to copy matches the name of an already\-existing file in the current directory or elsewhere in the hierarchy, that file is overwritten.  Other .flt files, as well as texture files, that are externally referenced by the named .flt file(s) are similarly copied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-pr " "path_replace"
Sometimes references to other files (textures, external references) are stored with a full path that is appropriate for some other system, but does not exist here.  This option may be used to specify how those invalid paths map to correct paths.  Generally, this is of the form 'orig_prefix=replacement_prefix', which indicates a particular initial sequence of characters that should be replaced with a new sequence; e.g. '/c/home/models=/beta/fish'.  If the replacement prefix does not begin with a slash, the file will then be searched for along the search path specified by -pp.  You may use standard filename matching characters ('*', '?', etc.) in the original prefix, and '**' as a component by itself stands for any number of components.

This option may be repeated as necessary; each file will be tried against each specified method, in the order in which they appear in the command line, until the file is found.  If the file is not found, the last matching prefix is used anyway.
.TP
.BI "\-pp " "dirname"
Adds the indicated directory name to the list of directories to search for filenames referenced by the source file.  This is used only for relative paths, or for paths that are made relative by a -pr replacement string that doesn't begin with a leading slash.  The model-path is always implicitly searched anyway.
.TP
.B \-f
Force the copy to happen without any input from the user.  If a file with the same name exists anywhere in the source hierarchy, it will be overwritten without prompting; if a file does not yet exist, it will be created in the directory named by -d or by -m, as appropriate.
.TP
.B \-i
The opposite of -f, this will prompt the user before each action.  The default is only to prompt the user when an action is ambiguous or unusual.
.TP
.BI "\-d " "dirname"
Copy model files that are not already present somewhere in the tree to the indicated directory.  The default is the current directory.
.TP
.BI "\-m " "dirname"
Copy texture map files to the indicated directory.  The default is src/maps from the root directory.
.TP
.BI "\-root " "dirname"
Specify the root of the CVS source hierarchy.  The default is to use the ppremake convention of locating the directory above the -d directory that contains a file called Package.pp.
.TP
.BI "\-key " "filename"
Specify the name of the file that must exist in each directory for it to be considered part of the CVS source hierarchy.  The default is the ppremake convention, "Sources.pp".  Other likely candidates are "CVS" to search a CVS hierarchy, or "." to include all subdirectories indiscriminately.
.TP
.B \-nc
Do not attempt to add newly-created files to CVS.  The default is to add them.
.TP
.BI "\-cvs " "cvs_binary"
Specify how to run the cvs program for adding newly-created files.  The default is simply "cvs".

.B \-h
